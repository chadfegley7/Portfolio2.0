      <b>2nd Place Hack for Homelessness</b> A web based app that hopes to bring families together again with their loved ones that are homeless. With no login or registration, it's as easy as writing a simple email. Using Geo-Location, we are able to find your exact location and pin your virtual notes on a map using Google Maps API. Families can go on this app and search by name or location and look through our database of the homeless that have come through our app and left a note in hopes of it reaching their family. Hopefully this can be an app to help fight the homeless problem that is increasing in our communities.
